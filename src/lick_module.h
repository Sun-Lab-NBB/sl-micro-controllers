 * @brief The header-only file for the LickModule class. This class allows interfacing with a custom conductive lick
 * sensor used to monitor the licking behavior of animals.
 *
 * This class was specifically designed to monitor the licking behavior of laboratory mice during experiments. This
 * class will likely work for other purposes that benefit from detecting wet or dry contacts, such as touch or lick
 * sensors.
 *
 * @section lck_mod_dependencies Dependencies:
 * - Arduino.h for Arduino platform functions and macros and cross-compatibility with Arduino IDE (to an extent).
 * - digitalWriteFast.h for fast digital pin manipulation methods.
 * - module.h for the shared Module class API access (integrates the custom module into runtime flow).
 * - shared_assets.h for globally shared static message byte-codes and parameter structures.

/**
 * @brief Monitors the state of a custom conductive lick sensor for significant state changes and notifies the PC when
 * such changes occur.
 *
 * This module is designed to work with a custom lick sensor. The sensor works by directly injecting a small amount of
 * current through one contact surface and monitoring the pin wired to the second contact surface. When the animal,
 * such as a laboratory mouse, licks the sensor while making contact with the current injector surface, the sensor
 * detects a positive change in voltage across the sensor. The detection threshold can be configured to distinguish
 * between dry and wet touch, which is used to separate limb contacts from tongue contacts.
 *
 * @note This class was calibrated to work for and tested on C57BL6J Wildtype and transgenic mice.
 *
 * @tparam kPin the analog pin whose state will be monitored to detect licks.
