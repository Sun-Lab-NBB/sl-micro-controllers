/**
 * @brief Wraps an Encoder class instance and provides access to its pulse counter to monitor the direction and
 * magnitude of connected object's rotation.
 *
 * This module is specifically designed to interface with quadrature encoders and track the direction and number of
 * encoder pulses between class method calls. The class only works with encoder pulses and expects the ModuleInterface
 * class that receives the data on the PC to perform the necessary conversions to translate pulses into distance.
 *
 * @note Largely, this class is an API wrapper around the Paul Stoffregen's Encoder library, and it relies on efficient
 * interrupt logic to increase encoder tracking precision. To achieve the best performance, make sure both Pin A and
 * Pin B are hardware interrupt pins.
 *
 * @tparam kPinA the digital interrupt pin connected to the 'A' channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kPinB the digital interrupt pin connected to the 'B' channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kPinX the digital pin connected to the index ('X') channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kInvertDirection if true, inverts the sign of the value returned by the encoder. By default, when
 * Pin B is triggered before Pin A, the pulse counter decreases, which corresponds to CW movement. When pin A is
 * triggered before pin B, the counter increases, which corresponds to the CCW movement. This flag allows reversing
 * this relationship, which may be helpful, depending on how the encoder is mounted and wired.
