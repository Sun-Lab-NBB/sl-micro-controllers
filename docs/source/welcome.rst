Welcome to ataraxis-micro-controller API documentation page
===========================================================

ataraxis-micro-controller is a C++ library for Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers that integrates user-defined hardware
modules with the centralized communication interface client running on the host-computer (PC).

This library is part of the broader 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun Lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. It has a companion interface library written in
Python, `ataraxis-communication-interface <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-communication-interface>`_, intended
to allow the host-computer (PC) to control the microcontroller hardware running this library.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
`ataraxis-micro-controller GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller>`_.
