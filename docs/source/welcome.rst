Welcome to sl-micro-controllers API documentation page
======================================================

This project aggregates the code and documentation for all Ataraxis Micro Controllers (AXMCs) used in Sun
(NeuroAI) lab data acquisition pipelines.

This project is based on the broader 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun Lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. Primarily, this project specializes the interfaces
developed as part of `ataraxis-micro-controller <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller>`_ library to
manage the hardware used to conduct experiments in the lab.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this project. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
`sl-micro-controllers GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-micro-controllers>`_.
