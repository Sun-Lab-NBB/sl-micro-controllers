Welcome to sl-micro-controllers API documentation page
======================================================

This project aggregates the code and documentation for all Ataraxis Micro Controllers (AXMCs) used in
`Sun (NeuroAI) lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ data acquisition pipelines. It is designed to work together
with the main `sl-experiment library <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment>`_.

Primarily, this project specializes the interfaces developed as part of
`ataraxis-micro-controller <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller>`_ library to manage the hardware
used to conduct experiments in the lab.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this project. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions:
`sl-micro-controllers GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-micro-controllers>`_.
